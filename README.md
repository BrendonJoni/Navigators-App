#ChangeLog  
-This rebranded application that we designed as a team changed the appllications structure and styling 
- The application had been using one screen to navigate when we first submitted it but upon further improvements we ended up using a stack naviagator all screens are in one folder

High-level structure

App entry: App.tsx mounts the navigation container and loads ScreenNav.
Navigation: ScreenNav.tsx defines a native-stack navigator and registers each screen component (Login, Main, SixMonths, SixWeeks, FirstAid, Sewing, Cooking, GardenMaintenance, ChildMinding, LifeSkills, Contact, TotalFees, etc.).
Screens: all UI screens live in screens (each file is a self contained React component that receives navigation via props).
